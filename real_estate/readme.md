### Advantages of Real Estate Investing

- inflation hedge: land appreciation is 4% higher than inflation; paying with inflated dollars later
- equity: the portion of your original house price on which you no longer owe
- land demand: many communities have slow growth or no growth policies

### Real Estate Cycle

- macro economic cycle, local busienss cycle, community cycle
- causes: developers are entrepreneurials and driven by short-term planning;
- sustained recession is a good time to buy
- different types of properties could be at different stages of cycle
- normal cyclke are 5-8 years, in some cases 10-12 years

### Stages of Development

A geographic area will typically go through a series of stages, phases, and plateaus over time.

1. For example, the normal stages are development (growth)
2. stabilization (maturing, plateauing)
3. conversions (from apartments to condos)
4. improvements of existing properties
5. decline of improvements (deterioration)
6. redevelopment (tearing down of older buildings and new construction, with more efficient use of space).

### What Affect Prices

- stages of cycle
- interest rate: higher interest, lower price
- tax: municipal property taxes, property taxes, speculator's tax
- rent control: disincentive to investor real estate activity
- **population shift**: location with attractive business, employment, tourism, retirement opportunity will attract immigrants
- vacancy level: low vacancy can force people to buy home; high vacancy reduces investor confidence
- location
- land availability: dependent on zoning restriction, natural shortage, limit on dev
- public perception and fomo
- politics and policy
- seasonality

### Key Strategies

- buy properties that are easy to maintain and high in demand: SFH, condo, duplex, triplex, fourplex; avoid apartment building
- attempt to make a low downpayment; offset a low down payment with:
  - vendor-take-back mortgage
  - high-ratio financing
  - second mortgage
- strive to break-even cashflow; avoid debt servicing of the property; should cover all expenses: mortgages, repair, maintenance, allownce for vacancy, condo fees, taxes, property management
- rely on professionals at all time for peace of mind: lawyer, accountant, financial planner, building inspector, appraiser, contractor, realtor, property manager
- never pay more than fair market value unless there are other collateral benefits to you
- keep rent at market maximum; manage expenses at market minimum
- three month contingency reserve fund for unexpected expenses or vacancy
- buy within 4 hours driving distance from where you live
- principle of pyramiding; on systematic basis
- consider tax benefits, consult lawyer and tax accountant, don't fall for tax shelter; rule-of-thumb: property should be invest-worthy without counting for its tax benefits
