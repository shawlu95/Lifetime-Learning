### Prologue

- Management is largely by example
- Executives are not born effective; they must learn and practice
- The artio of leader's performance to the entire team remains constant: to improve the team, leader must improve his performance
- First responsibility: determine one's own specialty; focusing on improving weakness is foolish and irresponsible
- Address decieicncy that impededs "full flowering" of your strength;
- consolidate time into blocks
  - most lucid time: quiet period for thinking, 90 minutes. Must do regularly
  - Chunk of deliberately unstructured time for people and random stuff
  - Standing meeting for dialogue, debate, decision.
- run lean: organisation internal mass grows at faster rate than external surface; increasing amount of energy is devoted to managing internal mass, as organisation grows
  - one person who does one thing well is better than dividing the responsibility among multiple lesser persons
- do not confuse scale of impact with scale of organization
