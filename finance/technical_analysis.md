### The Dow Theory

* the market average discounts everything
* three trends:
  * primary trend: lasts years, define bull/bear market (tide)
  * secondary trend: corrections, lasts week or month (wave)
  * Minor trends: unimportant (ripple)
* Bull market phase
  1. Accumulation: financial reports are worst, public is disgusted with stock market
  2. steady advance, increase earning and trading activities
  3. Speculation: penny stocks going wild, value stocks refuse to follow
* Bear market
  1. Distribution phase: far sighted investors get out
  2. Panic phase: vertical drop, and rapid recovery
  3. Prolonged distress selling, bear market is over before all the bad news are out
* the two average must confirm: dow jones and railway average must both confirm to signal reversal of trend
* volume goes with trend: in bull market, there's heavy volume on uptrend, thin volume on correction
* flat market may replace secondary trend: the longer the plateau, the quick the breakout, the stronger the signal
* only closing price should be used
* a trend will continue until a reversal has been confirmed, like inertia
* dow theory helps trading primary trend, not secondary
