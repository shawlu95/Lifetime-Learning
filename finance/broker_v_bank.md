## Difference between Brokers and Banks

- when banks receive deposit, it credit liability and debit asset.
  - on the liability side, it is the amount deposited, and needs to pay back when asked
  - on the asset side, it is invested and can appreciate
- when brokers receive deposits, it doesn't show on balance sheet. Owners can choose how to invest it. Brokers also don't have access to the underlying assets, which are held by a custodian firm.
- if a broker fails, clients' assets are safe.
- if fund VOO collapses, it will be converted to another broker's broad index fund. Asset will not be lost, but market risk still exists (market would be in shit if VOO collapses).
