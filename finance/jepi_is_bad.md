## JEPI is Bad

- it is the best covered call ETF
- it delivered 12~13% in the recent 2 years due to a perfect mix of conditions
- expect 5~8 dividend yield, and 6~10% total return annualized (in comparison, VOO returned 9.93 % since 2013)
- the 10+% returns is unlikely to continue
- most of the CAGR comes from dividend, the principle barely grows
- the principle declines when adjusted for inflation
- dividend is taxed when distributed, high tax bracket earners give up half of the dividend
- must reinvest the post-tax amount fo preserve capital
- the tax is not a problem in a Roth IRA
- delivered 30% less volatility than VOO
- ELN exposed to counter-party risk
