Argentina and Brazil talk about having a currency union. This is more of a political talk to rid dependence from USA than practical planning. Currency union requires all participating countries to have equal interest rates otherwise an arbitrage opportunity would exist.

An implication is that all participating countries must be in the same economic cycle (boom or bust) as is the case in Eurozone, otherwise a uniform interest rate would create stress on some of the participants. For example, Brazil has low inflation while Argentina has 100% inflation. They can't have the same level of interests rate. Hong Kong dollars is pegged to US dollars and its interest rate has to rise along with the US dollars, even if the Hong Kong economy doesnâ€™t need for such a high interest rate.
